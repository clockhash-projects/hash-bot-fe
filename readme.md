## Getting Started

To start building a new web component using Stencil, clone this repo to a new directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clockhash-projects/hash-bot-fe.git hash-bot
cd hash-bot
git remote rm origin
```

and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To build the component for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the unit tests for the components, run:

```bash
npm test
```


```html
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/hash-bot"></script>
<!--
To avoid unpkg.com redirects to the actual file, you can also directly import:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpha-interface@0.0.1/dist/hash-bot/hash-bot.esm.js
-->
<my-component first="Stencil" middle="'Don't call me a framework'" last="JS"></my-component>
```

This will only load the necessary scripts needed to render `<my-component />`. Once more components of this package are used, they will automatically be loaded lazily.

You can also import the script as part of your `node_modules` in your applications entry file:

```tsx
import 'foobar-design-system/dist/foobar-design-system/foobar-design-system.esm.js';
```

### Standalone

If you are using a Stencil component library with `dist-custom-elements`, we recommend importing Stencil components individually in those files where they are needed.

To export Stencil components as standalone components make sure you have the [`dist-custom-elements`](https://stenciljs.com/docs/custom-elements) output target defined in your `stencil.config.ts`.

For example, given you'd like to use `<my-component />` as part of a React component, you can import the component directly via:

```tsx
import 'foobar-design-system/my-component';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <my-component
          first="Stencil"
          middle="'Don't call me a framework'"
          last="JS"
        ></my-component>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
```
